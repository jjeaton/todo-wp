# todo-wp

Inspired by (ToDoMVC)[http://todomvc.com], a proof-of-concept implementation of the TODO list, using React on the front and WordPress as a storage backend.

## Vision

The goal of this project is to help WordPress developers build their JavaScript skills, particularly around the use of the new WP REST-API. This initial implementation is based on the (React example for ToDoMVC)[http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/], but the vision goal is to provide a number of example implementations.

## Running The Example

(Add step by step instructions)

## Status

This is currently a very rough proof-of-concept implementation. 

### TODO (Ironic)

- [ ] Create a WP plugin that defines the TODO post type
  - [ ] Provide a field for the "done" status and an API for checking it.
- [ ] Document using OAuth rather than a hard-coded password
- [ ] Improve the React code
